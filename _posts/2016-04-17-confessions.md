Just to let you know where this is going, I'm going to be writing about my pain. This is a cathartic exercise. It may be a bit academic ... because I'm a bit academic. 
It may be a bit painful because confronting one's inadequacies is always painful and if you're reading this we probably share some inadequacies.


The thread on the main page will only show brief thoughts. Specific thoughts will be explored in their own section.

That's all for now. It's late.
